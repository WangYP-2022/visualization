1. What software did you use?
I used Excel Pivot Charts, which provides quick, interactive visualizations through its built-in charting capabilities. This tool is widely accessible in workplaces and educational settings, requiring no programming knowledge.
2. Who is your intended audience?
City administrators and policymakers who need to understand the geographic distribution of EarlyON centres and the balance between school-based and community locations across different cities.
3. What message are you conveying?
The visualization shows Toronto dominates with 77 total centres, far exceeding other cities. The second chart reveals that Toronto and Scarborough have more school-based centres (31 and 32 respectively) than community locations, while other cities show the opposite pattern. This suggests different service delivery models across regions.
4. What design aspects did you consider?
I used blue and orange (Excel defaults) for contrast between location types. The bar chart format allows easy comparison across cities. Value labels on bars enable precise reading. However, the default styling could be improved—the grid lines and generic colors lack the polish of custom design.
5. How did you ensure reproducibility?
Excel's reproducibility is limited. While the pivot table auto-updates if source data changes, the exact steps taken (field selections, sorting, filtering) aren't documented in code. Someone would need manual instructions to recreate this. Unlike scripted approaches, there's no version control or transparent methodology.
6. How did you ensure accessibility?
Excel provides basic accessibility—high contrast between bars, clear labels, and numeric values. However, color alone distinguishes categories (problematic for colorblind users), and there's no alt text. The interactive dropdown adds functionality but may not work with screen readers.
7. Who might be impacted?
Families in smaller cities (East York, York) see dramatically fewer options. School boards in Toronto and Scarborough bear more responsibility for hosting centres. Policymakers might use this to justify—or question—resource distribution across the Greater Toronto Area.
8. How did you choose features?
I focused on city and school location status to show geographic and institutional distribution patterns. I excluded language services, agency names, and operating hours to maintain focus on location-based equity questions.
9. What 'underwater labour' contributed?
Creating the pivot table required understanding field relationships, deciding on aggregation methods, and multiple attempts at layout. I likely explored other visualizations before settling on these bar charts, tested different city groupings, and cleaned city name inconsistencies in the data. The polished charts hide trial-and-error in category arrangement and formatting choices.
