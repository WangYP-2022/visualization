1. What software did you use?
I used Python with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas. These open-source libraries provide professional-grade visualization capabilities while ensuring reproducibility. Python was chosen over tools like Excel or Tableau because it allows complete transparency in the analysis process—every step from data loading to chart creation is documented in code that others can review and replicate.
2. Who is your intended audience?
The primary audience is policymakers and community organizations working in early childhood education. The visualization aims to inform resource allocation decisions and advocacy efforts around language accessibility. Secondary audiences include researchers studying equity in public services and families seeking multilingual programs.
3. What message are you conveying?
The visualization reveals a significant language accessibility gap: 89% of EarlyON centres operate only in English, despite Toronto's exceptional linguistic diversity. With only 25 centres offering multilingual support, 7 with Indigenous programs, and just 2 with French services, there's a clear mismatch between community needs and service availability. This data makes a compelling case for policy intervention.
4. What design aspects did you consider?
I applied color theory strategically—blue for multilingual (trustworthy), red for French (alerting to scarcity), green for Indigenous (culturally resonant), and gray for English-only (neutral but dominant). The dual-chart approach was deliberate: the bar chart provides absolute counts for understanding scale, while the pie chart communicates the stark proportional imbalance. I minimized chart decoration to maximize the data-ink ratio, ensuring every visual element serves the message. Typography choices—bold titles, clear labels with values—create hierarchy and immediate comprehension.
5. How did you ensure reproducibility?
Using open-source Python libraries with documented version requirements ensures anyone can recreate this visualization. The code includes clear comments, parameterized file paths, and links to the original Toronto Open Data source. This reproducibility is crucial—without it, the visualization becomes a one-time artifact that can't be updated or verified, limiting its value for ongoing policy monitoring or scientific scrutiny.
6. How did you ensure accessibility?
I used high-contrast colors distinguishable for color vision deficiency and added numeric labels so meaning isn't conveyed by color alone. Large, bold fonts improve readability, and the 300 DPI output ensures clarity across media. The dual representation (counts and percentages) accommodates different cognitive preferences. Future improvements could include embedded alt text and pattern fills alongside colors for enhanced accessibility.
7. Who might be impacted?
Immigrant, refugee, and Francophone families face direct barriers when services don't match their language needs, potentially affecting their children's development outcomes. Indigenous communities see limited cultural and linguistic representation. The visualization could influence budget allocations affecting staff hiring and training, while also shaping public discourse about equity in public services. There's responsibility here—this data could either drive positive change or be misused to justify inadequate services as acceptable.
8. How did you choose features to include/exclude?
I focused exclusively on language-related columns to maintain a clear, focused message. Including geographic data or service hours would dilute the core insight about language accessibility. This decision involved trade-offs—we lose understanding of where language services are concentrated—but gains clarity. The visualization answers one question well rather than many questions poorly.
9. What 'underwater labour' contributed?
The final two-chart visualization masks extensive invisible work: exploring 35 data columns to understand structure, researching policy context (Official Languages Act, Truth and Reconciliation), iterating through design choices (testing color palettes, chart types, layouts), handling missing data, and creating comprehensive documentation. I also considered ethical implications—how might different communities interpret or be affected by this data? This "underwater labour" represents roughly 80% of the project effort but remains invisible in the polished final product. It's what transforms raw data into actionable insight.
